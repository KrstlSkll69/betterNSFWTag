# betterNSFWTag
Add NSFW badge next to those type of channels. </br>

Hello, if you are here, that could mean one of few things. If you just found this plugin on GitHub then Hi. But if you use the CSS snippet version of this plug-in, you received the notice about it being discontinued… </br>
unfortunately, due to some changes within Discord code, the snippet heavily relied on `:has()` </br> I have spent many moons trying to figure out how to write the snippet without using that and I could not figure it out. As such, I have decided to discontinue the snippet in favor of a plug-in that doesn’t lag discord as the snippet did. </br>
